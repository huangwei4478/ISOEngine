Simple "2.5D" engine for game boy
---------------------------------

This is a simple engine that allows to make "pseudo-3D" games for Nintendo Game Boy using
GBDK-2020.

Unfortunately, it is rather slow for action games, but it is still sutable for something 
turn-driven. The speed increases when you make simple scenes.

You need the latest version of GBDK-2020 (3.1.1 for now) to compile this example. I'm also
using the tool from ZGB engine to convert the "Gameboy Tile Designer" tiles into the source 
file and a tool to convert the description of the scene into the source file (tool source 
is included).
